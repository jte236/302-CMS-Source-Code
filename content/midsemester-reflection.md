What a crazy semester this has been. Who would have thought we would have been having class during a global pandemic? This class has really opened my eyes to the importance of content and that it can’t all be about presentation. Enough of that though.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class and review what we have learned this semester: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
	- Over the past 8 weeks we have defined a lot of key concepts of Web Content Management. Some of them being Content, Workflow, Presentation, Storyboarding, and Comparing CMS’s. These concepts are super important in this job field especially if you’re going into content management. Some of these concepts I already use in the field at my internship which shows me just how important they really are. For more on the induvial topics check out my learning modules on my website [here]( https://confident-jones-82287b.netlify.app/).

2. I can describe and compare content management systems.
  	- This one we have just really began doing but can already see the value in it. This semester so far, we have use two different CMS’s. *Hugo* and *Word Press*. While they are both are Content Management Systems, they are very different and are used to complete very different goals. Which is what * Why Organizations Pick CMS X Over CMS Y, By Deane Barker* is trying to get across. You can’t expect a system to do y when it’s built to do x. The best way to sum up this section is by this quote from that article:
> “CMS X can automatically push article titles and links into Twitter and Facebook. We don’t want to have to build that.”

This is what comparison is all about if a CMS can make something easier or offers something you need that another one doesn’t then that’s the one you should use.

3. I can manage content using established workflows
   	- This has been the most useful and real world applicable I can of the class. We have gone over what workflows are and the job roles are needed in content management. The big ones are Editors, Developers, Admin for our class. In corporate America there are a couple additional jobs that would also need to be filled. The second biggest part of this I can we discussed is workflow management systems and there were a few to look at. The two I looked at were [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Planner](https://tasks.office.com/). In class we use *Microsoft Teams* to communicate with the professor and with each other so our group choose planner since they were both *Microsoft* products and we used planner in an earlier assignment. The biggest takes away so far is that workflows are super important to make sure deadlines are met and that the group is aware of where a project is, who is currently working on it and how they can help finish it up.

4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
   	- This one I’m going to keep kind of brief since this tie in with the other I can’s. This semester like I mentioned before I am maintaining one site with *Hugo* which can be found [here](https://confident-jones-82287b.netlify.app/). On *Hugo* I post all my learning modules as well as a get to know me page. I also use *Hugo* to practice certain aspects of content management out since it’s my personal class site. One of the biggest things was theme and making it my own. Also, with *Hugo* it’s really awesome because we have to use *Netifly* and *GitHub* to manage website. Getting hands on experience with things like *GitHub* are super valuable when looking for a job in the future. The other site is *WordPress* while having that skill is super important, they handle everything for you so setting up a webpage doesn’t take a lot of technical know how.

5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    - I think I miss spoke earlier when I said workflows were the most important I can. While they are super important self-directed learning and resources is the greatest I can we have and the most practical in the workplace. I cannot tell you how many times in my internship that I haven’t known how to do something and I either had to find a guide online or do some PD (Personal Development) or self-learning to figure it out. With development jobs 90% of what your coding is already done so finding something similar online or a guide online can save you a lot of time which is why I say it’s so useful. If you want an example checking out my website has a new theme which I had to use a guide to setup the theme.
