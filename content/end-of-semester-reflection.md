End of the semester reflection
==============================

I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
------------------------------------------------------------------
We used this I can all the time in this class during the semester. I feel like this is the most important one out of all of them when it comes to I cans since this 
is what the whole class was about. Some of the thing we have covered are Content, Workflow, Presentation, Storyboarding, and Comparing CMS’s. These concepts are 
super important in this job field especially if you’re going into content management. Some of these concepts I already use in the field at my internship which shows 
me just how important they really are.  I’ve already seen examples of the importance of content manage key concepts when building a website on WordPress for my mom. 
For more on the induvial topics check out my learning modules on my website here. 

 I can describe and compare content management systems
 -----------------------------------------------------
In America there is always the next best thing or bitter rivals trying to swing you to their product over another one. The same thing is true for content management 
systems. Never settle for one unless it completes fulfills what you are looking for. Over the semester we have really dug into comparing two content management 
systems: Hugo and WordPress. After an entire semester of deep comparison and review I can say that WordPress is the better content management system over Hugo. 

I can manage content using established workflows
------------------------------------------------
This has been the most useful and real world applicable I can of the class. We have gone over what workflows are and the job roles are needed in content management. The big ones are Editors, Developers, Admin for our class. In corporate America there are a couple additional jobs that would also need to be filled. The second biggest part of this I can we discussed is workflow management systems and there were a few to look at. The two I looked at were Trello and Planner. In class we use Microsoft Teams to communicate with the professor and with each other, so our group choose planner since they were both Microsoft products and we used planner in an earlier assignment. This one in my opinion is the second most important I can of the semester. I have gotten lucky and held an internship where one if not the biggest focus is on the flow of work and getting task done as a team. So, having to learn these skills is so great in setting us up for success in the real world.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This one I’m going to keep a little bit shorter since this ties in with the other I cans. This semester like I mentioned before I am maintaining one site with Hugo which can be found here. On Hugo I post all my learning modules as well as a get to know me page. I also use Hugo to practice certain aspects of content management out since it’s my personal class site. One of the biggest things was theme and making it my own. Also, with Hugo it’s really awesome because we have to use Netifly and GitHub to manage website. Getting hands on experience with things like GitHub are super valuable when looking for a job in the future. The other site is WordPress while having that skill is super important, they handle everything for you so setting up a webpage doesn’t take a lot of technical know-how.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
-------------------------------------------------------

This I can is the probably the third most important I can we have. While they are all super important self-directed learning and resources is one of greatest I can we have and the most practical in the workplace. I cannot tell you how many times in my internship that I haven’t known how to do something and I either had to find a guide online or do some PD (Personal Development) or self-learning to figure it out. With development jobs 90% of what your coding is already done so finding something similar online or a guide online can save you a lot of time which is why I say it’s so useful. If you want an example checking out my website has a new theme which I had to use a guide to setup the theme.
