This week was good. I personally enjoy an async feel to the class. But I was able to get a lot done. I feel like this week we are finally moving into the meat of
the class. I'm very excited to see where the class goes. 
Let's go through each one: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
    
   This week I feel like we do this every week. This week I feel like we finally got to content management and got to test out
   storyboarding feature when we made dummy pages for the final assignments and started to get a picture of what we wanted them to look like.

2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

   This week I feel this week we did not cover the comparing of different cms. We mostly focused on setting up dummy pages on *Hugo*. 
   Hopefully we can move onto a new system soon and start to compare them.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

  This week I feel that this I can was hard as well. Seeing as there wasn't any group work and the work was dummy pages the need of workflow was kinda irrelvant.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
    
   I feel like this will always be something we cover every learning module. This week I used 
   *GitHub* and *Hugo* like last week to publish our Learning Module for the week.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    I feel that this week I did not use this I can much this week. I really just used *Github* to create dummy pages for our final assignments.
    
This week I was a little different feel. But I was able to identify 3 of the 5 I can's from this week's content.
