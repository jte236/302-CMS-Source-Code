This week was super crazy. The end of the semester is approaching super quick and with it being shortened the work load is really pilling up. Anyway I thought the content we converd this weeknwas super helpful and very interesting to learn about.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week we focused on how content should be aggregated. Which i didnt realize is such a big issue and deal when your working with CMS's. After this weeks module I truely see how important it is and how we can use it to manage and make our content much better.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week I got to see even more comparisons of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. This week we broke down how content aggregation works in both *WordPress* and *Hugo*. 
    We got to see how they aggregate content and which model they use and, if we thought it was effective.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this I can suffered a lot. Our group work is starting to break down and its affecting our grades. The admin of our group is trying to do stuff about
    it but the group just isn't responding, as well as certian group members carrying all the weight for the whole group.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week explored how each platform aggreatges content and how we can put that into our own sites.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resouces from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
