Let's go through each one of them I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week was *MultiChanneles*. We talked about how to get our content seen by the most amount of people possible.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week I got to see even more comparisons of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. This week was all about Multichannels and we got to investigate how both 
    sites handle them. After so many weeks of comparison, I can confidently say that *WordPress* is better than *Hugo* especially this week with multichannels 
    and plugins.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - Our workflow is still breaking down and its getting very frustrating, people still aren't carrying out simple jobs like edting there blog post or pages
    leaving the developer to do more than his portin of the job.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week explored how multicahnnel plugins work, where we can find them, and how to add them to our site.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resources from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
