This week was good. I personally enjoy an async feel to the class. But I was able to get a lot done. I feel like this week we are finally moving into the meat of
the class. I'm very excited to see where the class goes. 
Let's go through each one: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
This week I was a little different feel. But I was able to identify 3 of the 5 I can's from this week's content.
