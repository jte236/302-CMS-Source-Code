This week was good. I personally enjoy an async feel to the class. But I was able to get a lot done. This week I feel we are taking a step away from content and looking at web design. I feel like the reading set up this project this week very well. Talking about the differnces in web design and web content management.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

    - This week we covered this I can pretty well. We talked about content and presentation. We covered if they should be considered seperate entities or lumped
      together. I personally feel they should be lumped together. In the create activite we focused on just presentation.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week we still haven't ventured outside of Hugo, but I feel a change coming since we are suppose to start with wordpress this coming week.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this assignment was based indivdual based so I didn't use any workflow. Hopefully next week we can get into groups and get the workflow flowing.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - Again we used *Hugo*, *GitHub*, *CSS*, and *Templeting*. Now *Templating* for us was looking through theme on Hugo and applying them to out website. But it
      does give me/us a chance to learn hugo backend a little more indepth. I  ended up having to rewrite my whole config file. 
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - I actually used this one this week. I used the guide on canvas to add theme to *GitHub*. Then my theme still wouldn't show up so I used the README guide 
      to walk through the problems and figure out what I needed to change on my config file.

This week was really fun. I enjoyed geeting to pick a theme for my Hugo site and learning more, how
Hugo works and how we change the theme.
