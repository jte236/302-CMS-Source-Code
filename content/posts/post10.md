This week felt a little slow and off. I was the only person to show up to class on friday so it was a little weird to just sot and work on stuff in silence, but it was nice to have the professor there to answer questions or problems that might have come up.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week was focsed on peer reviewing/ editing which a major part of creating content, and we also focused on content modeling which is another important
   aspect of CMS's
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week I got to see even more comparisons of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. This week we broke down the attributes of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. We got to see how
    they filter and group information, adn how basic content modeling works.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this I can suffered a lot. Our group work is starting to break down and its affecting our grades. The admin of our group is trying to do stuff about
    it but the group just isn't responding
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week we setup and learned about attributes and how *Hugo* and *WordPress* use them.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resouces from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
