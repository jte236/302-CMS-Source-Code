Today was my second in-person class for this class. This week in class we created an about page with an introduction 
to who we are with an image. The point was to learn markup langauge using a language called *markdown*. During this week of class
we went through some more of the 5 I cans and re-visited some of them as well. 

Lets go through each one:

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
    
   This one I can defiently say we covered this week. In the *Learn* section of the module we read about what 
   content is. Which I would say is the main concept in Content Management.

2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

   For this I can I feel like we havent started into this once since up to now we are only using *Hugo*. Moving
   forward when we move to wordpress this will be more usefull and focused on.

3.
