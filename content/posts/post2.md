Today was my second in-person class for this class. This week in class we created an about page with an introduction 
to who we are with an image. The point was to learn markup langauge using a language called *markdown*. During this week of class
we went through some more of the 5 I cans and re-visited some of them as well. 

Lets go through each one: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
    
   This one I can defiently say we covered this week. In the *Learn* section of the module we read about what 
   content is. Which I would say is the main concept in Content Management.

2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

   For this I can I feel like we havent started into this once since up to now we are only using *Hugo*.       
   Moving forward when we move to wordpress this will be more usefull and focused on.

3. I can manage content using established workflows

   We have touched this a lot again this week. Setting up github and netlify allows me to have a workflow to
   write code and get it to live very easily.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
    
   I feel like this will always be somthing we cover every learning module. This week we use *GitHub* and 
   *Hugo* to create an about page and write this learning module.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    This one I really used this week. I was trying to resize an image in *markdown*. While I wasn't able to
    to find an answer to the question I was looking for. I did find some useful markdown cheat sheets I can 
    moving forward.
    
This week I identified all but one of the I cans which will be addressed in the weeks to come.
