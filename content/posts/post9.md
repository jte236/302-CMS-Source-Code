This week was good. We took a break on learning CMS content to focus on reviewing and Peer review. Which you could argue is an important part of CMS since you need
peer-reviewed content.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

This week was sort of an off week. Since it's midterms we turned in a few drafts for semester projects on *WordPress*. The other biggest focus this week was on peer reviewing
we had a whole reading over it. We have began a discussion on the importance of peer reviewing and how to complete it, so in the coming weeks we can properly peer review
other groups mide semester projects.

I know this learning module is different from the usual ones but like I said this week was a little bit of an off week.
