Overall this wek has seemed really good. I unfortunaly missed class because I was getting released from isolation but the topic this week actually looked like a
good one.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

    - This week we looked a lot at the features of content management systems and to not to overexpect things from those systems. But for a key concept I feel that 
    would be that content is *KING*. Yes the themes and styling are cool but when deciding on a CMS your main selling point should be about the content.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week we contuined with *WordPress*. As we dig deeper into *WordPress* its nice to go back to *Hugo* for the learning modules. It gives me a chance to compare
    and contrast the two softwares.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - As I mentioned before this week in trasitioning to *WordPress* we really dove into our *workflow* to get
    our work done. I will admit it was rough and we have some kinks to work out but I feel once we are able to get back in class the group work should improve.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week we used this I can as well and as we continued a new technology in *WordPress*.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found last week are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resouces from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
