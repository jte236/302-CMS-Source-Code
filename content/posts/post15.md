Let's go through each one of them I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week was *peer review*. Now we talked about this earlier in the semester as well, but as the semester comes a quick end we are revisitng this for our
   final big project due at the end of next week.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week was all about *peer review*, but still every week we dig into differences in *Hugo* and *WordPress*. Overall after the whole semester I would say
    that WordPress wins overall, its a much better CMS than Hugo is.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - Our Workflow this week seems to be holding, after we meet in class to figure stuff out it seems that we are at least able to complete group asasignments, and
    get the final projcets done in time for submission.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week we really did not cover this area.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resources from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
