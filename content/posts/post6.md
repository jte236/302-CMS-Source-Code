This week was again intersting. We have moved online due to covid which is totally understandble as I want everyone to be safe, but I feel like group work is
almost impossible. Many students aren't comftorable with the content and the very little development we do and it makes getting group work done very hard. Also I
feel that a lot of students have just given up. I know in my group some members have just stopped communictaing which again makes grouo work very hard. But
hopefully when we return to class this group work will get better.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

    - This week we covered this I can pretty well. We focused heavily on workflow due to this being the first test of our workflow and first group assignement due.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - Fianlly this I can gets filled. This week we began with WordPress. So I can start to finally compare and contrast the differnecs between *Hugo* and *WordPress*.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - We also finally got deep into this I can this week. As I mentioned before this week in trasitioning to *WordPress* we really dove into our *workflow* to get
    our work done. I will admit it was rough and we have some kinks to work out but I feel once we are able to get back in class the group work should improve.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This we we used this I can as well and learned a new technology in *WordPress*. Which is a CMS.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - We used this I can in the learning module. We idenitfied go-to sources for *WordPress* that we can turn to if we get stuck and need help.
