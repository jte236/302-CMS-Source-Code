As the semester is coming to a quick stop, everything else is too. These last two weeks are about to be crazy. But this week I started to see the value in this 
class. My mom is starting a small business and asked me to build her an e-commerce website with an attached blog. It's like she knew I was in a class all about 
this. With this week being over plugins it has been one of the most useful classes yet! I am looking forward to the final two weeks of this class.
Let's go through each one of them I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week was *Plugins*. Like I mentioned before it has been one of the most useful weeks of the semester in my opinion. While plugins are not the backbone of
   web dev or content management, plugins do make tasks easier or enable something the *vanilla* version would not allow. 
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week I got to see even more comparisons of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. This week was all about plugins and we got to investigate plugins for both
    Hugo and WordPress. After so many weeks of comparison, I can confidently say that *WordPress* is better than *Hugo*.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this I can is still suffering a lot. Our group work is starting to break down and it's affecting our grades. Only certain members of the group are 
    putting in the work to complete the job. The admin of our group is trying to do stuff about it but the group just isn't responding, as well as 
    certain group members carrying all the weight for the whole group.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week explored how plugins work, where we can find them, and how to add them to our site.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resources from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
