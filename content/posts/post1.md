Today was my first in-person class for Content Management System. It was so refreshing to finally be back in class again. This blog will serve as a continuing project
to grow my skills as the class goes on. Having just a couple class under my belt so far it can be hard to even begin looking at the 5 I cans that have been given. But I
can say that two statements we have already started on in class today. Those are one "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.", and two "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning". I can say we started on these for a couple of reasons. The first reason is in class today we set up
GitHub, netlify, and Hugo. These services have technologies we are imploying are directly related to Content Management. The second reason is with class being half
online I have already started looking for resources to help me learn while distant.
