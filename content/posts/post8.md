This week was good I missed lecture but im starting to see the benefits of this class and already picked up my first contract for a *WordPress* site, which is awesome
and this class has taken on a while new meaning for me. Granted the site is for my mom's startup buisness but this really good practice and puts my skills to the test.
Let's go through each one of the I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

    - This week was more about comparing CMS's which I guess is still a super important skill to have when working and being an admin for a company needing one. This
    week was reading heavy but the points made were very helpful when evaulating CMS's for your company.
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week we contuined with *WordPress*. As we dig deeper into *WordPress* its nice to go back to *Hugo* for the learning modules. It gives me a chance to compare
    and contrast the two softwares.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this I can suffered a lot. Our group work is starting to break down and its affecting our grades. The admin of our group is trying to do stuff about
    it but the group just isn't responding
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week we used this I can as well and as we continued a new technology in *WordPress*.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resouces from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
