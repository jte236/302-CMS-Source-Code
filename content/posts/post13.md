Let's go through each one of them I can's for this class: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management

   - This week was *Advertisments*. We talked about how to monetize our content management website 
    
2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

    - This week I got to see even more comparisons of *WordPress* and *Hugo*. This week was all about advertisments and we got to investigate how advertisments for 
    both Hugo and WordPress. After so many weeks of comparison, I can confidently say that *WordPress* is better than *Hugo*.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

    - This week this I can is still suffering a lot. Our group work is starting to break down and it's affecting our grades. Only certain members of the group are 
    putting in the work to complete the job. The admin of our group is trying to do stuff about it but the group just isn't responding, as well as 
    certain group members carrying all the weight for the whole group.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

    - This week explored how advertisment work, where we can find them, and how to add them to our site.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    - This week was a great example of this I can but also why the resources we found 2 weeks ago are so important. A team member ran into a blog problem
    and used the self-directed resources from last week to figure out the WordPress issue.
