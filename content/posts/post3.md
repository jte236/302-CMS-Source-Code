Today was interesting. We tried to have our in-person class online due to the lack of students able to come into class. I thought the first part
of the class went well. The part that was hard for me was when we broke into groups. I felt doing this over zoom was extremely difficult. 
But overall, it was that bad of an experience. Let's now move on to the I can statement for this week and how we covered them.
Let's go through each one: 

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
    
   I would say we expanded this week as well. We started forming workgroups and, 
   workflows in class which are major parts of managing content.

2. I can describe and compare content management systems.

   This week I feel this week we did not cover the comparing of different cms. We mostly focused on groups
   and workflows.
  
3. I can manage content using established workflows

   This week we hit this I can the hardest out of all five I can's. This week we set up the Microsoft Planner tab, and Wiki page tab. 
   We used Planner for the Kanban Processes and to track our workflow. We used the Wiki page to layout group rules and roles going forward.
   
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
    
   I feel like this will always be something we cover every learning module. This week we use the Planner and wiki to establish our workflow. Along with GitHub and 
   Hugo like last week to publish our Learning Module for the week.
   
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
    
    I feel that this week I did not use this I can much this week. I hold an internship in web development and we use team and the KanBan process
    all the time to manage our workflow.
    
This week I was a little different feel. But I was able to identify 3 of the 5 I can's from this week's content.
